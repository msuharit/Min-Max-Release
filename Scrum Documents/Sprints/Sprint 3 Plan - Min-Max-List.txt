Sprint completion: 11/19/24
Revision Date: 11/05/24
Revision Number: 1
∙ Goal: Short, 1-2 sentence description of the high-level goal(s) for the sprint. 
* Have multiple options for seeing Todo lists, such as items due today or items due in the next week, the ability to categorize lists through making custom lists. This may include priority items as well. 
∙ Task listing, organized by user story: This section lists the user stories, in priority order from  most important (top) to least important (bottom). Within each user story, there needs to be a  list of tasks required to implement the user story, along with the time estimate for each task (preferably less than or equal to 6 ideal hours). This should look like: 
As a user, I want multiple to do lists to categorize and filter tasks so that I can be more organized [5]
* Create backend implementation of tasks linking to a todolist name  (5 hours)
* Create frontend being able to route to multiple to-do lists  (3 hours)
* Specialized todo lists that show filter tasks by due date, alarm time, etc (3 hours)
Total for user story 1: 11 hours
  





As a user, I want to be able to schedule when a task should be completed by and be penalized if I don't have it finished [5]

* If a task is incomplete by a set time it will show up as red on front end (2 hours)
* Have a todolist dedicated to showing thats that scheduled due (4 hours )
* Have a todolist dedicated to showing past due (4 hours)

∙ Initial scrum board: Also known as a task board, the scrum board is a physical board labeled  as such with sprint number and project name and located in the lab. This board has four  columns, titled user stories, tasks not started, tasks in progress, and tasks completed. Index  cards or post-it notes representing the user stories and the tasks for this sprint should be placed  in the user stories, tasks not started, and tasks in progress columns. Tasks associated with a user  story should be placed in the same row as the user story.
